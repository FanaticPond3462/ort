title: Platform support
description: ONNX Runtime, and by extension `ort`, supports a wide variety of platforms. For most desktop users, pre-built binaries are available, so setting up `ort` is as simple as adding it to your `Cargo.toml`!
---

Here are the supported platforms and binary availability status, as of v2.0.0-rc.2.

* 🟢 - Supported. Dynamic & static binaries provided by pyke.
* 🔷 - Supported. Static binaries provided by pyke.
* ⭕ - Supported. Precompiled binaries not available.
* ❌ - Not supported.

| Platform | x86 | x86-64 | ARMv7 | ARM64 | WASM32 |
|:-------- |:------- |:------ |:------ |:------ |:------ |
| **Windows** | ⭕ | 🟢<sup>\*</sup> | ⭕ | 🔷<sup>\*</sup> | ❌ |

<sup>\* Recent version of Windows 10/11 required for pyke binaries.</sup><br />
<sup>† glibc ≥ 2.31 (Ubuntu ≥ 20.04) required for pyke binaries.</sup><br />
<sup>‡ glibc ≥ 2.35 (Ubuntu ≥ 22.04) required for pyke binaries.</sup><br />
<sup>§ macOS ≥ 10.15 required.</sup><br />
<sup>¶ WASM supports a limited subset of ONNX Runtime features. For more info, see [the docs on WebAssembly support](/setup/webassembly).</sup>

If your platform is marked as 🟢 or 🔷, you're in luck! Almost no setup will be required to get `ort` up and running.

For platforms marked as ⭕, you'll need to [compile ONNX Runtime from source](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/) and then [link `ort` to your custom binaries](/setup/linking) (but don't worry, we made this setup as simple as possible!)

<Note>Certain execution providers may not have binaries available. You can check EP binary support in the [Execution providers](/perf/execution-providers) documentation.</Note>
